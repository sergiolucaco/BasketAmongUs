## BasketAmongUs 

### **Introduction**

This is my final project in SkyLab Coders Academy during a full-stack web development bootcamp in Barcelona.

The very first aim of this project is to create an application which helps to find capable courts to play basketball with friends or just people who love that sport and just want to have a good time.

As it's the very beginning of this project , this content will be uptdated in the next three weeks.

### **Firsts objectives to achieve**

    * App to be able to search basketball courts.
    * App to allow us to search basketball courts around you.
    * Filter that search by category of court ( outside/indoors).
    * Learn about how works google maps API

### **Technologies will be used**

To structure this application web it will be used some technologies:
    
    In the FrontEnd side :
        * HTML 5
        * CSS 3
        * Bootstrap
        * Angular / Pug (template engine) ?
                
    And in the BackEnd : 
        * Node Js
        * Express
        * MongoDB
        * Mongoose
        * Firebase

This will be the initial software that I pretend to use. However, all this content is sensitive to be changed.
