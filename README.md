## BasketAmongUs 

### **Introduction**

This is my final project in SkyLab Coders Academy during a full-stack web development bootcamp in Barcelona.

The very first aim of this project is to create an application which helps to find playable courts to play basketball with friends or just people who love this sport and just want to have a good time.

### **Current funcionalities**
 
    * Allow us to search basketball courts around your geolocalization (distance in km).
    * Filter that search by category of court ( outside/indoors).
    * Create new courts just by dragging your marker and filling an easy form.
    * Possibility to isolate just one court by accessing to its detailview.    

### **Incoming Funcionalities**
 
    * Login and signup system.
    * Possibility to edit one court created by yourself.
    * Possibility to add comments in the detail view of every court.
    * Possibility to add photos of the b-meetups.
    * Room chats in every court.
    * Calendar implementation.    

### **Technologies used**

To structure this application web, as a MEAN project, it will be used some technologies:
    
    In the FrontEnd side :
        * HTML 5
        * CSS 3
        * Bootstrap (Bootstrap UI Angular Incoming..)
        * Angular Js ( also NgMap, ngGeolocation )
                
    And in the BackEnd side: 
        * Node Js
        * Express
        * MongoDB
        * Mongoose


This is the current software that I use. However, all this content is sensitive to be changed.
